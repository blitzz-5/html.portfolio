<p>Hello, My name is Michael Toller. I am learning to become a webdeveloper. I have always loved technology
  and am always interested in learning new things. I work part time at Covenant Baptist Church. I am the worship
  and media pastor. My role consists of leading the worship service on Sundays and leading the praise band. I play
  guitar and sing. I also manage all the media ministry of the church. This consists of any graphic design, video projects
  social media management, as well as the chruch website.
</p>

<p>I've always wanted to learn more about coding and learn how to do web devlopment. When i saw the Udemy course come
  available, I immediatly signed up. It has helped so much already, as I already know so much more than what I did before.
</p>

<p>This web Portfolio is just a small way to show what I've learned and am learning as I continue to gain knowledge in web
  development.
